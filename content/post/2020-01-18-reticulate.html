<p>I’m an R user first and foremost, but I’ve wanted to learn Python for years now.
While I’ve worked through many introductory materials, there’s no way to really
learn a programming language until you use it on a
regular basis. The main reason I don’t use Python is that I already know how to
do everything I need to do in R. But it occurred to me that a good way to force
myself to learn Python is to write posts on how to do every task in Python that
I would normally do in R. That way I’ll be able to reference this blog if I want
to use Python for any task I’ve already figured out in R.</p>
<p>Another reason I haven’t used Python so much is that I’m not a programmer by
training. R is the first programming language I learned, and
(RStudio)[RStudio.com] makes it so easy to develop software for data analysis.
Using Python is a very frustrating task for someone like me. But RStudio has
made it easier and easier to use Python inside of an R session, in an RMarkdown
document, and a as a stand-alone text document.</p>
<p>For example, I can use Python to read in the air quality data, and print readings
in July where the temperature is above 90 degrees.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import pandas

air = pandas.read_csv(&quot;airquality.csv&quot;)
air = air[(air[&#39;Month&#39;] == 7) &amp; (air[&#39;Temp&#39;] &gt; 90)]
print(air)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##     Ozone  Solar.R  Wind  Temp  Month  Day
## 68   97.0    267.0   6.3    92      7    8
## 69   97.0    272.0   5.7    92      7    9
## 74    NaN    291.0  14.9    91      7   14</code></pre>
<p>This data can be used in an R session. The air Python DataFrame is passed on to
R inside an object named <code>py</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)

head(py$air)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
## 68    97     267  6.3   92     7   8
## 69    97     272  5.7   92     7   9
## 74   NaN     291 14.9   91     7  14</code></pre>
<p>My plan is to start with how to read data into Python and cover data manipulation,
graphics, statistics, and machine learning.</p>
