      <description>I’m an R user first and foremost, but I’ve wanted to learn Python for years now.While I’ve worked through many introductory materials, there’s no way to reallylearn a programming language until you use it on aregular basis. The main reason I don’t use Python is that I already know how todo everything I need to do in R. But it occurred to me that a good way to forcemyself to learn Python is to write posts on how to do every task in Python thatI would normally do in R.</description>

      <description>If you’ve been introduced to R as a simple way to do data analysis you might havecome across this strange operator, %&amp;gt;%. It’s called a pipe because it passesdata from one function to another. Here’s an example of subsetting andtransforming data using the pipe from the magrittr package:
library(magrittr)dat &amp;lt;- airquality %&amp;gt;%subset(Ozone &amp;gt; 40) %&amp;gt;%transform(Celsius = (Temp - 32) * (5/9)) %&amp;gt;%head()dat## Ozone Solar.</description>
